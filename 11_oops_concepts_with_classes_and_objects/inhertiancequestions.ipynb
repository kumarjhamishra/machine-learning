    "## Lesson: Single and Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Single Inheritance Basic\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Animal` with attributes `name` and `species`. Create a derived class named `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and adds an attribute `breed`. Create an object of the `Dog` class and print its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Method Overriding in Single Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Dog` class, override the `__str__` method to return a string representation of the object. Create an object of the class and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Single Inheritance with Additional Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Dog` class, add a method named `bark` that prints a barking sound. Create an object of the class and call the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Multiple Inheritance Basic\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Walker` with a method `walk` that prints a walking message. Create another base class named `Runner` with a method `run` that prints a running message. Create a derived class named `Athlete` that inherits from both `Walker` and `Runner`. Create an object of the `Athlete` class and call both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Multiple Inheritance\n",
